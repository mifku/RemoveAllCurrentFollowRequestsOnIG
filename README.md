# RemoveAllCurrentFollowRequestsOnIG

a pure javascript code to remove all current follow requests


**DISCLAIMER** : I wrote this code for personal usage i dont have any responsibilites that will occur on your computer.






You should be logged in Instagram with your account. 

And should be on https://www.instagram.com/accounts/access_tool/current_follow_requests page. 

Press F12 on chrome or open developer tools on whichever browser you use. 

Then manipulate scripts constant texts (which are on fist lines of code) according to you language. 

---I choosed to travese on html tree by texts cause instagram 'div' class names are probably created dynamically and they are meaningless(at least for me). ---

Click on Console tab on dev tools.

Then paste your manipulated script into Console and press enter.



Watch the console...
